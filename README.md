# Form Builder


# Input fields

All input fields must follow a simple convention based protocol.
Every input field must:
 - Accept a `value` prop which is the field's value
 - Accept an `onChange` function as prop which is called whenever a value changes


Considerations / todo
 - Support for collaborative editing
 - Powerful validation rules
 - i18n
 - List item edit modality
